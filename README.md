# The README

You need to create .env file with

API_BASE = Base URL of the API
API_USER = The API user 
API_PASS = The password for the API user

The example should look something like this:

API_BASE = "https://mybilling.telinta.com:8442/rest/"
API_USER = 'test_user'
API_PASS = 'test_pass'

Please pay desired attention to have /rest/ API instead of SOAP.

For examples check the example.php file.

Thank you!
